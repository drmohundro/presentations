Swift was introduced by Apple at WWDC in _2014_.

That wasn't that long ago. Seriously.

Note:

* Any guesses when your other favorite languages came out???
* Ruby? (95) C#? (2000)
* So Swift is new. Still.

Swift took language ideas

> ["from Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, C#, CLU, and far too many others to list."](http://nondot.org/sabre/)

(Swift language creator Chris Lattner)

Note:
And Mr. Chris Lattner is no longer with Apple. Or Tesla. Now he's making artificial brains at Google.

Features include:

strong typing, implicit typing, mutable and immutable variables, OO, functional language features, generics, cross-platform support, and more.
